This is the beginning of a CV project. I want to create an AR
program that can display images or videos on surfaces dynamically i.e.
if the camera is looking at a coffee table, it can 'figure out' that it would
display the image on a parallelogram overlayed on top of it.

At the moment, I am testing feature algorithms to determine which ones are worthwhile.
